# Breast Cancer Prediction REST API

### Machine Learning · MLOps · Python · Docker · CI/CD

>> ### **Project Status:** Active Development (Pre-Production)
>> ### This project is under active development and intended as a production-oriented ML engineering showcase.
>> ### The API contract is considered stable, but internal components may evolve.

This repository showcases a production-oriented Machine Learning API for breast cancer prediction, built with Python and Flask, following modern ML engineering and MLOps best practices.

The project is intentionally designed to reflect real-world ML workflows, emphasizing reproducibility, clean architecture, automated testing, and deployment readiness rather than notebook-driven experimentation.

## Project Highlights (Why this project matters)

- End-to-end ML pipeline: model training → persistence → inference via REST API

- Production-ready structure using the `src/` layout (PEP-compliant, import-safe)

- Reproducible environments with `uv` and locked dependencies

- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

- Containerized deployment with Docker

- Explicit input validation aligned with the trained model

- Clean separation between training, inference, and tests

This project is suitable as a portfolio reference for ML Engineer / Applied Data Scientist roles.

## Technical Stack

- Language: Python 3.9+

- API Framework: Flask

- ML Stack: scikit-learn

- Dependency Management: `uv` (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`)

- Testing: Python-based unit & integration tests

- Containerization: Docker

- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

- Project Layout: `src/`-based architecture

## Architecture Overview

```bash
Training Pipeline
└── training.py
    ├── Data loading & preprocessing
    ├── Model training
    ├── Model evaluation
    └── Model persistence (model_breast_cancer.pkl)

Inference Pipeline
└── app.py
    ├── Model loading
    ├── Strict numerical input validation
    ├── Prediction endpoint
    └── JSON response

Quality & Delivery
├── test_app.py      → Automated tests
├── Dockerfile       → Reproducible builds
└── CI/CD pipeline   → Continuous validation
```

The design mirrors how ML systems are typically deployed in cloud and MLOps environments, separating experimentation from serving.

```

This layout follows industry-standard Python packaging practices, improving maintainability and scalability.

## Environment & Reproducibility

Dependencies and virtual environments are managed using `uv`, ensuring:

- Deterministic builds

- Fast dependency resolution

- Clean separation from system Python

```bash
uv sync
```

All commands are executed explicitly inside the managed environment:

```bash
uv run python -m src.api_breast_cancer_prediction
```

## Model Training

```bash
uv run python -m src.api_breast_cancer_prediction.training.py
```

- Trains a supervised ML model on numerical features

- Persists the trained artifact as `model.pkl`

- Ensures compatibility between training and inference pipelines

## Running the API

```bash
uv run python -m src.api_breast_cancer_prediction
```

Default endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Example health check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests validate core logic

- Integration tests validate API behavior

- Tests are executed:
    - Locally via `uv`
    - Automatically in CI on every push / pull request

```bash
uv run python -m src.api_breast_cancer_prediction.test_app.py
```

## CI/CD & Automation

The GitHub Actions pipeline:

- Installs dependencies using `uv`

- Runs automated tests

- Builds the Docker image

- Pushes the image to Docker Hub on merge to `main`

This reflects real CI/CD pipelines used in production ML systems.

## Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -t breast_cancer_api .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 breast_cancer_api
```

The container encapsulates:

- The trained model

- The API

- The exact runtime environment

## Engineering & ML Focus

This project intentionally prioritizes:

- Engineering discipline over notebooks

- Reproducibility over ad-hoc experimentation

- Deployment-readiness over toy examples

It is designed to demonstrate how Machine Learning models are actually shipped, monitored, and maintained in professional environments.
